Game Introduction: 
“The connect-4 is a simple game involving 2 players. Each player takes turn to slot one chip at a time into an encasement. The player who upon placing one chip creates a configuration where there are 4 chips of the same color adjacent to each other wins the game. Two chips are considered adjacent to each other if they are vertically, horizontally or diagonally next to each other. In the LED display and I/O pin configuration, each display dot on the LED array module corresponds to a pair of green and orange light LEDs. During game play, the inputs to the circuit correspond to the column position where the user intends to slot the chip.”
In my project, I choose the enumeration approach to list all the playing situations and the winning conditions.
Firstly, from the requirement, the connect-4 game’s encasement is  , so that 64 slots are waiting to be placed. I define the input array is 2-diensional, respectively represent the row and column of the site. And clear the chip as define each logic array is equal to 0 in the beginning and they will turn to 1 or 2 depending on which player inserting after inserting a slot. 
In second part is the checking part to tell who wins immediately. While there are 3 directions to be aligned in a line of 4 slots, respectively vertically, horizontally and diagonally, considering every winning situation with 2 players, the total situation number is 130. They are listed in the Verilog code as well.
